<article><div><h3>Sexual harassment is frequently overlooked in India, even in the age of the MeToo movement which saw survivors share their stories and led to the downfall of numerous public figures worldwide, in politics, business, the entertainment industry, and beyond. 

India was no exception to this trend, with women from all walks of life sharing their stories of sexual harassment. Nonetheless, the practice remains a depressingly common phenomenon in India, where a woman is sexually harassed every twelve minutes. 
<li>Harassment need not be confined to physical activities as the recent scenarios witnessed, related to cyberbullying, workplace harassment, power harassment, retaliation harassment, psychological harassment, etc. are also existing in our environment. Sexual harassment involves inappropriate promises, rewards in exchange for sexual favors or unwelcome sexual behavior that is offensive, humiliating, or intimidating, or use of explicit or implicit sexual overtones, etc. Harmonizing our Indian law, sexual harassment violates the fundamental right of gender equality and life with dignity under Article 14 and Article 21 of the Indian Constitution respectively. Other laws include Section 294 of the Indian Penal Code which deals with obscene acts by a person or singing, recitation, or utterance of any obscene songs or just words in a public place to annoy others. Section 354 of IPC talks about punishment for inflicting criminal force on a woman or assaulting her in order to outrage her modesty. Section 376 of IPC deals with rape. Section 510 of IPC deals with misconduct in public by a drunken person.</li>
<li>But our Indian laws have yet remained to be backward in the place of taking a stance for men and passing laws to protect them as well. In a survey, it had been found 53.9% of 115 people who were questioned for the survey believe that rape of men and boys is not an uncommon crime and it takes place more frequently than we are aware of, whereas, 45.2% believe that men being raped is not that common and is rare. Such surveys, to a great extent, draw a line to throw light upon the subsisting mentality of the society, where it states that narrow-minded people do exist in the society and harassment falls under the consequences of their actions. A news report from the Times of India newspaper highlighting a fact regarding male harassment in India, states – from the findings of a recent Economic Times-Synovate survey, the men need to be incorporated in that bill ASAP.

Of the 527 people queried across seven cities – Bangalore, Chennai, Delhi, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Mumbai, and Pune – 19% said they have faced some kind of sexual harassment at the office. In Bangalore, 51% of the respondents had been sexually harassed, while in Delhi and Hyderabad, 31% and 28% of those surveyed said they had been sexually harassed. Around 38% of the respondents across 7 cities in India said that in today’s workplaces, “men are as vulnerable to sexual harassment as women.” Therefore these surveys also support the fact that like women, men too need laws favoring them. Vishaka Guidelines came into action, for the protection of women in their workplace, after the case of Vishaka and Ors vs. the State of Rajasthan, when the petition was filed under public interest litigation on the grounds of violating fundamental rights. Unlike these, it would be wiser if in advance the laws were to be framed to deals with the cases which mostly get injustice due to lack of laws and implementation favoring the contempt for men and transgender.</li>
<li>Increasing cases of sexual harassment
Throwing light upon some real-life stories 
A twenty-four-year-old student of Kolkata was traveling in a crowded metro, where she could feel that a man brushed his genitals against her back which made her uncomfortable. She was afraid to raise her voice as she had often seen girls being asked to get off the train if they had too much problem.
A twenty-eight-year-old lady was waiting in the cloakroom for her luggage, it was late at night, she was reading her book. Another man was sitting in front of her, but she felt an utmost uneasiness as that person was staring constantly which made her uncomfortable. Later on, when she spoke out, that man started to yell at her and said that, because of girls like you, rape cases occur.</li>
<li>Reasons for the increase in sexual harassment
One of the major reasons behind sexual harassment is the silence of the victims. In the cases where women become the victim, in majority of the situations, she keeps things to herself. In public buses or trains, the common reaction to this is that the woman might leave the seat or change her place, and only a very few raise their voices against it. And even once she does so, the chances of people coming to her rescue is quite rare. From a very young age, women are taught to tolerate things and are habituated to live in the deep-rooted patriarchy. Even the elders never expect any change favoring them and assume that the coming generations will continue with this situation.</li>
<li>Reasons along with statistics
In a survey of 2016, 504 women were included in the polling procedure, from which the results turned out as four out of five women face sexual assault in public places like staring, insult, wolf-whistling, etc.
A survey of 2011 noted that 50% of the sexual harassment occurs in public buses while traveling. To this, the question lies: why do women not complain about harassment? 
A study of 2020 held that many people are not aware of the various types of harassment. It was found that 38.1% of the victims and 42.2% of the offenders are aware of the laws relating to sexual assaults. In the words of Kaushik Gupta, Calcutta High Court, advocate “Often men do not even realize what is a violation. For women, it has been so naturalized in their systems that if a man is touching her inappropriately in a bus or a public place, she may normally try to move away a bit without raising her voice. At times, there are cases of abuse where the woman has not understood that she has been violated. One of the principal reasons is that as a society, we have very little or almost no understanding of informed, enthusiastic consent.”
The other factors of this can be loopholes in our legal system. In cases of rape, the victim is the one who faces the utmost humiliation. Firstly, he or she faces the assault, and after that during the medical examination or FIR, it is that person again, who is made to feel uneasy and has to give answers for all the questions revolving around the details of the horrifying incident. Also when such an incident takes place, one suffers from trauma, so that it is not comfortable for the victim to approach the police station again and again, above that their truth gets challenged constantly by the laws. It may also take place that adjournments get delayed due to legal loopholes.</li>
<li>Impact on society
There are specifically two major consequences of harassment, one can be out of fear and rebelling and the other can be depression and suppressing of emotions. In both the consequences, the suffering of the victims is common. It depends on the person who is dealing with it. As women are always taught to be under the veil especially in rural areas and not to raise their voices, and the tough reality of poverty makes them stick to the situations of uneasiness for the sake of pleasing the society, in fact in all situations, it is the victim who suffers. In cases of men, they are treated as hard and tough so for them raising their voice in this regard questions their manhood. In the cases of transgender, society does not pay attention to them and often violates their dignity.

Thinking of workplace sexual harassment, it becomes miserable for the women being vulnerable, it becomes difficult for the concerned female to tackle the situation. Here the person’s mind gets confused on various grounds, such as career, job, money, financial freedom, family, children, society, etc. And once a mark gets splashed upon a lady, in reality, society tends to treat that person as if she has done something wrong. In many cases, women often get offers to perform sexual favors in return for promotions or can be threatened that they might lose their job as well. Sometimes the employee gets so traumatized that she even starts to become dysfunctional mentally and physically which consequently leads her to perform improperly in the workplace. But some fighters do exist in our society. Some females do fight back. After facing numerous sexual harassment the fear of society’s judgment gets diminished, instead, these acts install aggression and courage to fight back and teach the accused a lesson. After so much tolerance one feels like there is nothing to lose anymore and in reality, this attitude makes women bold and strong, unfortunately.</li>
<li>The Me Too Movement
For a long time, there has been a voice shouting for demanding equality for women, and still facing discrimination in various aspects and different corners of the society. But this is not bound to women only, but to the others as well. Previously, several protests have brewed up in demand of justice for the women who have faced discrimination, harassment, assault and so on. But for some reasons, and mostly lack of conclusive evidence, things have most of the time not worked out. The influence of customs and traditions in India has created an environment, for the girls to become tolerant in most situations for the sake of society, so in such situations, in the cases of sexual harassment, these women are deprived of justice because the society seems to be turning a deaf ear to their situation and the mental sufferring faced by them. Also our law which favors proofs and evidence, is blind towards the plight of these victims as mostly the harassment cases specifically visual and verbal ones are accustomed with insufficiency of materialistic proofs so as to support the circumstances with the codified laws.</li>
